## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security issue, please report it to us as soon as possible.

To report a vulnerability, send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the following details:

- A clear description of the security issue.
- Steps or code that can be used to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant information that would help us in resolving the issue.

Please refrain from disclosing the issue publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it.

## Security Practices

Our back end is built with security as a top priority, implementing several key practices:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: We employ robust mechanisms for authenticating users and authorizing access to data.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuous monitoring and logging help us detect and respond to anomalies quickly.
- **Regular Patching**: We keep our systems updated with the latest security patches.

## Community Contributions

Contributions to enhance our back-end security are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please create a pull request with a detailed description of your proposed changes.

We appreciate your support in maintaining the security of our application.
